----

## Starting project
1. Clone repository ```git clone https://github.com/MatveiAleksandrovich/Artificial-Intelligence.git```
2. Go to the directory you want to look at. More information about each directory can be found below
3. Run 'File_you_want.py'
4. Close file you can with <kbd>^C</kbd> or <kbd>⌘F2</kbd>

## - Directory: [Checkers](https://github.com/MatveiAleksandrovich/Artificial-Intelligence/tree/main/Checkers "Named link title")
  _Сheckers game with Artificial Intelligence based enemy-bot, through all the game process you can easily see how computer counts the right way to go. Also, it supports changing the number of steps the computer thinks ahead._

### Technology
* Python
* Pygame
* Minimax Algorithm 
  
### Starting project
1. Clone repository ```git clone https://github.com/MatveiAleksandrovich/Artificial-Intelligence.git```
2. Go to Checkers directory
3. Run 'main.py' file

### Сhange the difficulty
1. Go to file 'main.py'
2. On the position 28:58 there is an argument that changes difficulty by default it is 3, to make it easier set 2
